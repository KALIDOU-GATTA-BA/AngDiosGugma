<div style="text-align:justify">The foundation which led to the conception of the “Ang Dios Gugma Catholic Ministries, Inc.” community was due to a man’s quest for peace, happiness, love and forgiveness.
Burdened and pressured with too many problems in life, he was physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually exhausted. His life was miserable as he experienced sleepless nights, coupled with nightmares and nervousness. He consulted quack doctors for cure but to no avail. His situation became worst until he made a decision to end his life.
July 17-18, 1982 marked the conversion and the turning point of this person’s life when he attended a Spiritual Renewal in Leon, Iloilo. The renewal was sponsored by the St. Catherine Prayer Group. The “bug and kiss” of the Holy Spirit changed his life and brought into it a new meaning. The Lord opened this person’s mind about spiritual matters which led him to search for God’s Word and to read the Holy Bible seriously. In his thirst for the Word of the Lord, he joined various prayer groups which molded and formed him to what he is now.
On February 2, 1984, with the grace of God, a small community named “Ang Dios Gugma” was formed with Bro. Edwin A. Daulo as the founder and initiator. The said community was under the Holy Name of “Jesus Prayer Group” Arevalo, Iloilo City with Bro. Edwin’s immediate family as members as well as the Celina and Gepana families.
The Spirit of Jesus Christ moved the group to evangelize Jordan, Guimaras on the same year. But prior to that, the group prayed that they will be given a sign by healing Tatay Basilio Gepana, Sr. who was suffering from diabetes and who has a wound on his feet for almost 18 years which was slowly eaten by worms. As such, his condition was deteriorating. For 21 days of soaking prayer done by the group, Tatay Basilio got healed thus, opening the way for the Guimaras evangelization.
With the permission of Rev. Fr. Sergio Jamoyot, Parish Priest of Jordan, Guimaras, the group were allowed to conduct Prayer Meeting in the area. Later on that year, with the blessing given, the first Life in the Spirit Seminar (LSS) was given. It was followed by another LSS in the area thereby opening more communities in the Poblacion, Sanao and Morobuan, Guimaras. In the later part of 1985, the community in Jordan, Guimaras became “God is Love Prayer Group” registered with the Iloilo Catholic Charismatic Secretariat with Jose “Peping” Duran as the Coordinator.
In 1986, Bro. Anselmo Lacuesta and wife Sally, Chairman of Hiligaynon Seminar Ministry of ICCRS joined the community. In the same year, the founder and the Head Servant of the “Ang Dios Gugma”, Bro. Edwin A. Daulo, transferred his residence from Villa, Iloilo to
 Calaparan, Arevalo and was assigned to oversee the Calaparan Charismatic Group of the Our Lady of Miraculous Medal Prayer Group.
In 1988, Rev. Fr. Danilo Carolino C.M., Parish Priest of The Lady of Miraculous Medal Parish and ICCRS approved that the small community of “God is Love Prayer Group” will have Bro. Anselmo Lacuesta as its first Chairman/Coordinator.
On June 12, 1991, the Provincial Capitol Community under the Assumption Prayer Group joined the “God is Love Prayer Group”.
Last May, 1993 the Prayer Center of the “God is Love Prayer Group” was constructed and blessed during its 4th Anniversary Celebration.
The “God is Love Prayer Group” was officially changed to “Family of God is Love” in 1993. In that same year, the Provincial Capitol Chapter was made into a prayer group registered with the secretariat. The “God is Love Prayer Group” continued its mission of evangelization thus, opening communities in Quintin Salas, Ungka II, Timawa and East Baluarte. In New Lucena, the group was able to conduct a Life in the Spirit Seminar (LSS) in three (3) barangays such as Brgy. Dawis, Brgy. Badiang and Brgy. Balabag. The group was also able to give a Life in the Spirit seminar to three (3) barangays in Lambunao namely Brgy. Bon- bon, Brgy. Da-an Banwa and Brgy. Pajo. Later, the group has given LSS to Brgy Dawis, Pototan.
In September, 1994, Bro. Edwin desired to go into radio as the seed has been planted in his heart to proclaim the Word of God through the tri-media evangelization. However, before making a final decision, he contemplated on it further to make sure that the inspiration really came from the Holy Spirit.
During the “World Youth Day” and the visit of Pope John Paul II in Metro Manila in January, 1995, Bro. Edwin and the ADG Youth members were given an opportunity to attend said occasion. When Pope John Paul II gave his message which says, “Tell the world of His love”, Bro. Edwin felt a burning desire within him as the power of those words penetrated deep into his heart. This experienced further intensified his desire to go into the radio ministry.
The above occasion was followed by a three-day National Convention of Charismatic Renewal at the PICC, Manila of which Bro. Edwin was one of the participants. The Holy Mass was presided by Cardinal Sin, Cardinal Vidal and various Archbishops. Cardinal Sin told the participants that he had just received the blessing from the Pope and he wanted to impart this blessing to them. Bro. Edwin was very fortunate and blessed to have received said impartation.
During the plenary session of the convention, a cell grouping activity was done. Various subject matters were given for discussion. Bro. Edwin chose the subject matter of “evangelization.” To his surprise, almost all of his companions in the cell group that he

 joined had already a radio program ministry in their respective places in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.
Because of this experienced, Bro. Edwin finally made up his mind to go into radio. Thus, on March 16, 1995, the “Ang Dios Gugma” radio ministry was created. A 30-minutes slot at DYRP was given to Bro. Edwin for his radio program. This lasted for one month and one- half (1 & 1⁄2) only as DYRP stopped its operation.
On August 01, 1995, the ADG community was able to get a time slot for its radio program at DYBQ. The radio ministry likewise reached the Province of Capiz in 1999 through its radio program at DYJJ which lasted for a period of eight (8) months. In December, 2000, the ADG Community transferred its radio program from DYBQ to DYRI on both its AM and FM band. In August, 2001, the community again transferred its radio program from DYRI to Aksyon Radyo where it maintains a 30-minutes radio program from 2:30 – 3:00 p.m., Monday to Saturday.
On March 22, 2001, the ADG community got its registration from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with its registered name of “Ang Dios Gugma (ADG) Catholic Ministries, Inc.”.
Likewise in 2001, the “Ang Dios Gugma” television ministry came into being. The ADG community was able to get a 1 hour slot of TV program from Monday to Friday at Channel 43 of Cablestar. In 2005, with God’s grace and Divine providence, the 1 hour slot of TV program was changed to 24 hours and the operation of Channel 43 of Cablestar was transferred to the ADG tri-media ministry. In 2006, the ADG community was able to get another 24 hours slot of TV program at Channel 42 of Skycable thus, widening the scope of its evangelization program by reaching more televiewers.
The radio and television ministries paved the way for the creation of more ADG outreaches in various towns in the City and Provinces of Iloilo as well as in Negros Island.
In April 6, 2006, a Kinder School known as the “Ang Dios Gugma Catholic School, Inc.” was created. The students are mostly pre-school children of Calaparan and Calumpang, Arevalo, Iloilo.
In 2010, the “Ang Dios Gugma Catholic Ministries Foundation, Inc.” was formed. The ADG foundation aimed to develop both the spiritual and the physical well-being of individuals by proclaiming the Gospel of God and witnessing the love of Jesus Christ through the tri-media evangelization in order to inculcate the true Catholic Faith and Christian values to people of all nations and to support, finance and sponsor the education of the poorest of the poor members of society who will be called “Scholars of Hope”.
In order to maintain and deepen the spiritual aspect of each of the ADG members, the community conducts a formation/teaching activity for leaders and potential leaders every Monday at the Iloilo American Memorial School from 6:00 – 9:00 p.m., General Prayer Meeting every Thursday at the Sta.
